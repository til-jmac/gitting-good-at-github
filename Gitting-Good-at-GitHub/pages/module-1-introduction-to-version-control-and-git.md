# **What is Version Control?**

* Version control is a tool that allows you to track changes to files over time.
* This is most effective when working with text files but also works with other files.

---

# **What are the benefits of Version Control?**

* **Track Changes.** You can see who changed what to files over time.
* **File History.** Ability to revert back to previous versions of a file.
* **Collaboration.** Supports collaborating in files.

# **What is Git?**

* Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes.
* Changes are tracked locally on your computer and then synchronized with a remote repository (like GitHub).
* Each change is saved as a snapshot, not just differences.
* Enables offline work and syncing changes when you're ready.

* **Repository (repo).** A directory where Git stores the history of your project.
* **Commit.** A snapshot of your changes, along with a message describing what was done.
* **Branch.** A branch lets you work on changes separately from the main code.
* **Merge.** Combines commits from one branch into another.
* **Tracks Files.** Git tracks files and their file paths, not directories.
